# ðŸ›’ React Shopping Cart Challenge

This is my coding challenge solution for a responsive, accessible shopping cart built with React and SCSS. I utilized the [DummyJSON Cart API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/carts) for mock data.

## âœ¨ Features

- Fetches mock cart data from DummyJSON API
- Renders a list of products with title, and price
- Allows users to:
  - Remove individual products from the cart
  - Reset the cart to its original state of 6 products
- Displays cart summary:
  - Number of products
  - Total cost
- Componentized for reusability and readability
- Responsive layout with accessible markup

## ðŸ§± Built With

- React (functional components + hooks)
- SCSS (modular BEM styling)
- No external libraries other than React

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-cart-challenge.git
   cd react-cart-challenge
